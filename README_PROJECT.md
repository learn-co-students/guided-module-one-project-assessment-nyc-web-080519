## Project Overview

This is a final project for Module 1 of Flation School.

We were asked to build a **Command Line CRUD App** that uses a database to persist information. The goal of which is to demonstrate all of the skills that we learned in module one:

- Ruby
- Object Orientation
- Relationships (via ActiveRecord)
- Problem Solving (via creating a Command Line Interface (CLI))

**Minimum requirements** for this project were to build a Command Line App that:

1. Contains at least three models with corresponding tables, including a join table.
2. Accesses a Sqlite3 database using ActiveRecord.
3. Has a CLI that allows users to interact with your database as defined by your _user stories_ (minimum of four; one for each CRUD action).
4. Uses good OO design patterns. You should have separate models for your runner and CLI interface.

## Setup

1. Fork and clone this project repository.
2. From terminal run the app by typing in `ruby bin/run.rb`.
3. Follow instructions/prompts from our CLI app.
4. Enjoy!

We used the [Potter API](https://www.potterapi.com/) to seed our database and create students, professors, and houses. We created a list of courses and subjects and students randomly get added to 3 courses when we seed the database.
